## Nextjs is nothing but a framework built on the top of ReactJS. NextJS is the one the most popular JS Framework that is used by most of the developer now. I personally want to switch to most modern and future profe technologies. I know in the tech nothing is perment, we have to learn on the daily basis. Now this the NextJS time but after 2-3 or 5-6 Years there must be a technology that can replace NextJs. So from now we will stick here to get understanding of Nextjs.

# What is NextJS?
    * Next JS in Opensourse Framework that is build for making full stack websites. It is maintained by vercel comapany. vercel is company that most of the developer use to host their websites online for free.
    * Next JS is Javascript framework that helps developers to build Full stack website. We can build frontend and backend of the website using NextJs. that is why NextJs is becoming most loved technology in the market.
    * Next JS introduced some new features like SEO optimization, Server Side Rendering (SSR), Static Side Generation (SSG),File Based Routing and some other things.
    * React JS has so bad SEO Optimization score, But NextJS solve this problem.
    * NextJS load the content on server side and send the rendered content, that is why it feels so fast.
    * In react JS we have to do so many stufs for routing, but in Next Js we can do that by just creating folders for each route, like if we to create */about* page then in Next JS's APP folder we have to create *about* folder and then create a *page.jsx* file in that folder so it will work like link to that page.

# How React JS and Next JS works?

    ## React JS
        * When developer develops a react website and then he make a build of that website to host on platform like vercel or some others. at this time of making build of project react uses webpack, webpack takes time to make bundle of the code.
        * when finelly build is ready that converted or makes in javascript. when user load this content on his devices it takes time to load JS.
        * When content load in the user's system then it make call to API and get data then it shows in their website. if we see from the user's perspective this is little bit slower, bacause when user opeing website he has to wait for some time to load the data from the API. 
        * When Google's Crowlers or Bot comes to this webiste they will see that website is loaded but it has no data. so they think it is not geninue webisite or it has no data. so google crowler do not show this kinds of webisites in search result. that's why react based website has low SEO score. 

    ## Next JS
        * Next JS Developed and Maintained by vercel, it is open source framework, we can see the code of this framework on the github repo of vercel. 
        * When developer develop a website using next js, that time it use Rust internally to make build of the project. if we compare webpack and Rust package then rust is faster than it. so it make build fast.
        * When user come to Next Js website that time NextJS send the all the content. NextJS include all the contnet from the API into the responce code of user's query. User will get HTML, CSS file, these files are load faster than the JS files. that why Next JS website shows content faster than React Website. because react has to get data from the API,but Next JS already included the data in server side.
